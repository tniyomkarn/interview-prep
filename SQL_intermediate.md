SQL Aggregate Functions
-----------------------
arithmetic operators only perform operations across rows (within the same row of each row). Aggregate functions are used to perform operations across entire columns (muliple rows of data)

Hereâ€™s a quick preview:

- `COUNT` counts how many rows are in a particular column.
- `SUM` adds together all the values in a particular column.
- `MIN` and MAX return the lowest and highest values in a particular column, respectively.
- `AVG` calculates the average of a group of selected values.

SQL COUNT
---------
`COUNT` simply counts the total number of non-null rows.
